## FARID HOUSE SPA WEBSITE

This website was created as project for Code Institute as Interactive Front-end Project.
The main goal was representing a simple and elegant Spa Website that showcase the philosophy, the gallery, the team, the treatments and the location.



## UX 

The website has been build for the clients and for the new customers who want to see the services of the Spa.
I tried to keep it really minimal in order to focus on the 'relax' part. 
In my prospective as a customer I would like to see a spa website really clean and simple and that avoids to be confusive.
As a mobile user I would love to see Farid House Spa website mobile-friendly, to be intuitive, that allows me to see their philosophy, the pictures of the spa and the treatments given.
