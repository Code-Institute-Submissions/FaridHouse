# FARID HOUSE SPA WEBSITE

* This website was created as project for Code Institute as Interactive Front-end Project.
The main goal was representing a simple and elegant Spa Website that showcase the philosophy, the gallery, the team, the treatments and the location.



# UX 

* The website has been build for the clients and for the new customers who want to see the services of the Spa.
I tried to keep it really minimal in order to focus on the 'relax' part, I tried to make it harmonious as possible, so user can even relax by navigating in it.
In my prospective as a guest I would like to see a spa website really clean and simple and that avoids to be confusive.

* As a visitor I would like to see:
- A mobile-friendly website, to be intuitive, that allows to see their philosophy and their services and treatments. 
- A brief description of the company. 
- The services of the company.
- A responsive gallery, that changes size in mobile version, that has to be quick and accessible.
- Who works there? (The team).
- The SOCIAL MEDIA links, so I can contact them or tag the company in my images.
- The Cancellation Policy.
- Which kind of treatments and packages has the company? If the products are displayed, I would like too see a small description, the images and the prices.
- Appealing images, that attract the eye.
- A contact form so I can contact them about my enquiry. 
- Where are the company is located and a Map with the location.

* The color used for the website is #e7baa0 that fits with the concept of the SPA.

* Buttons are made all with the same style to make sure there is constancy.
