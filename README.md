## FARID HOUSE SPA WEBSITE

This website was created as project for Code Institute as Interactive Front-end Project.
The main goal was representing a simple and elegant Spa Website that showcase the philosophy, the gallery, the team, the treatments and the location.



## UX 

The website has been build for the clients and for the new customers who want to see the services of the Spa.
I tried to keep it really minimal in order to focus on the 'relax' part, I tried to make it harmonious as possible, so user can even relax by navigating in it.
In my prospective as a guest I would like to see a spa website really clean and simple and that avoids to be confusive.
As a mobile user I would love to see Farid House Spa website mobile-friendly, to be intuitive, that allows me to see their philosophy, the pictures of the spa and the treatments given.

## FEATURES

Farid House Spa website displays a sticky navbar, a footer, 3 pages (HOME, TREATMENTS AND CONTACT) and one modal.

*NAVBAR
Simple white coloured navbar that displays the logo of Farid House Spa, the homepage, treatments, COVID Modal and Contact Page. 
On mobile version the Navbar transforms in a hamburger menu.

*HOME
The HOME page is created on the first section with a background image that shows an animation text made with Javascript: 'RELAX AT OUR MASSAGE AND THERAPHY SPA', with a RESERVE button that brings the user to the contact page, so the user can contact to reserve any treatment and check avaiability.
Are also displayed the philosophy of the company, the services, a carousel gallery and the team.

*COVID Modal
Due to Coronavirus FARID HOUSE SPA will be closed, so I decided to create a Javascript Modal that shows the Governament advice. 

*TREATMENTS 
To make it simple as possible, Treatments page is divided in two categories, MASSAGES and SPA PACKAGES.
Every treatment and package has his own description and by clicking on the name, the price will be displayed. 
The colors and the style used for the name buttons are the same of the other buttons in order to create balance. 

*CONTACT 
Contact page displays: 
-Contact Form (Using Email.js) for user that would like to send and equiry. When form is sent, an alert will be displayed on the website.
-Locations.
-Next Opening (Using a CountDown with Javascript).
-Contact Number and Email.
-Google Map (Using Google Maps Api) with two marker clusters.
